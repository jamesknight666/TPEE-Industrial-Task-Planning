(Initial Observation)
The following describes the initial state of an industrial machine, including the machine formula, model, IP address, port number, connection status (0 = disconnected, 1 = connected), axis-enable status (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled), axis speeds, axis origin offsets, axis coordinates, and structural parameters. It also includes the correction file, control mode, model, connection status, parameters, and scanner field offsets of the scanner; the calibration file and model of the camera; the model, IP address, port number, serial port, connection status, object states (0 = off, 1 = on), and parameters of the laser; the current tool object, tool-retraction enable status (0 = off, 1 = on), and retraction distance; as well as the processing parameters. All information is recorded in the form of a dictionary:

(Select)
The following are the Task and a two-dimensional array of candidate plans for accomplishing the Task. You must select the optimal plan from these subtask plans. The selection criteria are:
1. Every step in the plan must strictly follow the subtask event formats specified above, and no expressions outside the defined formats are allowed.
2. Each event must comply with all the prerequisites and constraints described above.
3. Among the plans that can successfully complete the Task, choose the simplest one.
The plan must start executing from the initial state given in the (Initial Observation) and must be able to complete the Task. The following are the Task and all candidate plans. Please choose the best plan among them and print it directly.Only one plan may be selected, and it must be printed in full. Printing any additional characters is strictly prohibited：
